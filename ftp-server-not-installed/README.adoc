"Running FTP server software provides a network-based avenue of attack, and should be disabled if not needed. Furthermore, the FTP protocol is unencrypted and creates a risk of compromising sensitive information. Removing the vsftpd package decreases the risk of its accidental activation."

'''

This module makes sure that common FTP server packages are not installed
on hosts and thus also not running.

= Example

```console
# sudo apt install vsftpd
# cf-agent -KI
    info: Successfully removed package 'vsftpd'
```

= Adding exceptions

If FTP server packages are really needed on some specific hosts, they can be
marked as such by defining the `hardening_ftp_server_allowed` class in either
augments or CMDB.
